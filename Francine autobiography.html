        </header>    
            <p>Hi! i am Francine and people usually calls me france.I was born at Lapu-Lapu city on May 18 2007. Growing up, I have always had a passion for being a programmer.
             As I entered school, I discovered my interest in computers.This led me to pursue bIndtech major in programming. Throughout my life, I've faced a lot of challenges, but I've overcome them by seeking help to my parents and friends.
            Today, I enjoy a lot of things like reading books,watching movies,travel and many more. Looking back, I'm proud of what i achive in my life it might not be big or special but i am still proud of it even if its small and simple.
            My future goals include going abroad and getting rich. Few simple words, but they carry a lot of ambition and determination. I envision myself working hard, learning constantly, and seizing every opportunity that comes my way.</p>

            <h3 class="text below"></h3>
            <p>Things i do when I'm bored.</p>
            <p> When boredom strikes, I dive into my favorite pastimes to keep things lively and entertaining. I love getting lost in
            the colorful worlds of comics, where each page pulls me into thrilling adventures and quirky characters. Playing online
            games is another go-to escape—it’s exciting, competitive, and a great way to connect with others while sharpening my
            skills. And when I’m in the mood to relax, I enjoy watching vlogs, catching glimpses of different lifestyles, travel
            stories, or just fun everyday moments that make me smile. These activities never fail to lift my mood and keep boredom
            at bay.</p>
